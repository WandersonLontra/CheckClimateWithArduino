# 🚩ABOUT

The Project consists of measuring the temperature and humidity in a datacenter environment, and also giving a visual alarm when the temperature exceeds 25°C. It is useful to observe the environment's climate as a form to protect the servers acting quickly.

# 👀 OVERVIEW

- The system stores the temperature and humidity in the database every 30 minutes
- All the temperature storage are given as a JSON in one endpoint who is fetched by the Highchart's framework
- The system also shows off the temperature and humidity every 5 seconds directly on the DOM.

### It is the first version, my plain to the next step is sending e-mail to alert the right people.
